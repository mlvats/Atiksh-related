# Interview Feedback Summary & Action Items

## Summary of Feedback
- **Introduction & Resume Review (Good)**  
  Needs a more methodical self-introduction using the **EATS** framework (Experience, Accomplishments, Type of person, Strengths). Resume answers should focus on **challenges, failures, and learnings** rather than just job duties.

  Good examples provided, but needs to **connect actions to organizational goals**, avoid personal biases, and **show inclusiveness** with a big-picture perspective.

- **Conflict Management & Objection Handling (Needs Improvement)**  
  Needs to practice **calm listening**, focusing on **win-win solutions**, showing empathy, understanding the "why" behind objections, and rebuilding trust.

- **Leadership & Organizational Skills (Needs Improvement)**  
  Should avoid quoting famous leaders’ styles and instead **show own leadership style** with specific examples. Improve **prioritization skills** (Eisenhower Matrix) and be scientific in organizing tasks.

- **Investment Banking Knowledge (Good)**  
  Good understanding, but should **deepen knowledge** in financial statements, cash flow components, depreciation, amortization, and ratios.

- **Overall**  
  Shows maturity for age/experience but needs a **structured, analytical approach** to answers, **consistency in skill claims**, and possibly a **mentorship program** for behavioural and leadership growth.

# Search Fund Internship Strategy – Summary & Action Plan

## **Summary**
This training explains how college students with no finance experience can quickly land their first **relevant finance internship**, especially for investment banking preparation, by targeting **search funds**.

Search funds are small-scale private equity firms that raise money to buy and operate a single company, performing similar M&A work to larger PE firms but on a smaller scale.

### **Key Advantages**
- Open to hiring students without prior experience.
- Highly relevant M&A exposure (valuation, due diligence, deal sourcing).
- Remote and flexible (10–20 hrs/week during school).
- Can be secured in **1–2 weeks** if following the process correctly.
- Networking opportunities with experienced professionals (often ex-IB/PE and MBA grads).

### **Main Tactics**
1. Use **SearchFunder.com** to find opportunities:
   - Check the **Jobs** section first for posted internships.
   - If postings are limited, use the **Directory** and **Funds** section to cold-reach firms.
2. Focus on **funds in “Explore” stage** (best for deep deal work), then “Search” stage.
3. Apply broadly (2–3 dozen firms) and follow up.
4. Prepare for simple interviews:
   - Understand search fund basics.
   - Be ready for “Why do you want this?”, “Tell me about yourself”, and basic M&A concepts.
5. Choose offers based on **learning value**, not pay (many are unpaid).
6. Once hired, negotiate work hours upfront.
